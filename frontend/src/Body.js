Hanuman learns the purpose of Bheem's journey and offers him hair from his tail for the protection. Bheem, after reaching Mahendragiri meets pushpamruga and it agrees on a condition that it would follow him only a 'manovega'-speed at which mind moves. Bheem agrees trusting the tail hair. While leading the animal, whenever Bheem finds he cannot keep the pace with the animal, he drops a hair. Strangely a 'Shivalinga' appears just on the spot and Pushpamruga proceeds only after worshipping the linga. This gives Bheem sufficient time to adjust his speed. When they reach the place called 'Uppinangady', Bheem finds difficult and drops remaining one thousand tail hair. A thousand lingas appear and by the time animal completes worship, Bheem safely reaches Yagamantap. Thus it is believed that a thousand Lingas are found in the temple vicinity.One out of those Lingas found in the middle of the river sand becomes visible in the month of February.",time:"Timing: 9AM – 10AM is preferred", review: ["Peaceful"]
